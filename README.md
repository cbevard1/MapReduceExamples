MapReduceExamples
=================

The programs in this repository are all examples of simple map reduce jobs showing how to perform different counting techniques and how to work with different input formats.

Most examples can be run in eclipse, but they are all tested and run on my machine as a single node hadoop cluster. For hadoop installation instructions visit http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/single_node_setup.html
